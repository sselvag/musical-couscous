# Employee Tracker
  
## As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles and employees in my company so I can organize and plan my business. In this project, I need to create a Employee Tracker that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When you start the application, you shoud be presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.
  2. When you choose to view all departments, you should be presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
  3. When you choose to view all roles, you should be presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.
  4. When you choose to view all employees, then you should be presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.
  5. When you choose to add a department, you should be prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.
  6. When you choose to add a role, you should be prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.
  7. When you choose to add an employee, you should be prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
  8. When you choose to update an employee's role, you should be prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
